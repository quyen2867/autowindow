## MANUAL INSTALLATION

**Rename `ventoy.json.example` to `ventoy.json` before using**

Copy this ventoy folder to the root of Ventoy's ISO/data partition. The resulting configuration file must be located at `/ventoy/ventoy.json`.

The configuration applies to `/Windows/w11.iso`. Its unattend XML templates are stored at root `/`. Ventoy boots with the first selection after `10` seconds unless another option is chosen.
