**2. MODIFY `ventoy.json` FILE**

Modify `"auto_install"` block in `ventoy.json` file to use these scripts.

``` json
{
    "auto_install":[
        {
            "image": "/Windows/Windows11/w11.iso",
            "template":[
                "/full_dyn_C_D.xml",
                "/full_C_D.xml",
                "/full_C.xml",
                "/full_mandisk.xml",
