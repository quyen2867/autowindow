## <a id="why-autoinstaller"></a>💡 WHY AUTOINSTALLER?

> **Ever heard of `GHOST`?**

It is an "old school" solution to `clone` a machine to another one. A clone image might have Windows pre-installed, all the applications, drivers, and configurations you need. Easy to deploy, fast to restore, just a USB and you are good to go. However, if you are installing a fresh Windows from an shared image, think about it:

1. How about the `hardware configuration` is not the same? The drivers might *not be compatible* with the new machine. Good luck with `BSOD`!
2. Or, you don't like the idea of *sharing a cloned OS* with someone else? How about the `personalization`? How about the `privacy`? How about the `bloatware`? You may not want to share your custom configuration with others.
3. Or, the `corrupted` image that includes a `funny virus/malware`? You might not know *what has been added* in the image.

    ***Do you really trust the distributor?***

> **Here comes `AutoInstaller`**

Your machine, *your own personalized Windows*, softwares and configuration in your hand, fully installed with automation scripts.
